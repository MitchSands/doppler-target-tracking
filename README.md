# Doppler-Based Multi-Target Velocity Estimation

This project simulates and analyses Doppler-shifted signals from multiple moving targets (e.g. drones, planes, missiles) to estimate their velocities using short-time Fourier transforms and spectral peak interpolation. It demonstrates signal processing techniques relevant to defence-oriented tracking systems.

---

## Project Overview

- Simulates a sensor receiving a mixture of sine wave signals, each Doppler-shifted by target velocity
- Applies short-time Fourier transform (STFT) using windowed FFTs with 50% overlap
- Detects multiple frequency peaks per window using prominence-based peak finding
- Refines peak frequencies using logarithmic parabolic interpolation
- Classifies each peak by source and estimates velocity via Doppler equations
- Smooths results with moving average filters and outputs threat classification logic

## How It Works

1. **Signal Generation**
   - Three targets emit constant-frequency tones.
   - Each tone is Doppler-shifted based on velocity and summed into a single signal.
   - Gaussian noise is added to simulate realistic sensor noise.

2. **Signal Processing**
   - The signal is split into overlapping chunks and windowed with a Hanning filter.
   - FFT is applied to each chunk to generate a time-frequency representation.
   - Frequency peaks are found and refined with logarithmic parabolic interpolation.

3. **Velocity Estimation**
   - Doppler equation is used to estimate target velocities from peak frequencies.
   - Each frequency is classified to its likely source target.
   - Velocities are smoothed using a moving average filter.

4. **Classification & Reporting**
   - Final average velocities are classified into categories:
     - **Drone** (Low threat)
     - **Plane** (Medium threat)
     - **Missile** (High threat)
   - Outputs a textual threat assessment and recommended response.
